# Contributing to `music`

1. If you've got a quick fix, open a PR and add me (`pursuingpareto`) as a reviewer!
2. If you've got a more substantial idea in mind, create a new issue so we can discuss!
3. If you want to implement `music` in some other non-Kotlin programming language... go to town! 

## High-level vision
`Music` is a language that's meant to be implemented in other programming languages.

The goal is to make something that can serve as the "lingua franca" for complex systems. Imagine being able to inspect ALL parts of a codebase without having to learn all the abstractions it was built with. Wouldn't that be **cool**?!

It would be *super* cool! And `music` is a great contender for that lingua-franca because it is readable; expressive; and simple.

And the `music` API is really simple. It supports:

1. doing stuff *in sequence* (AKA `Melody`)
2. doing stuff *at the same time* (AKA `Harmony`)
3. branching
4. named functions with parameters

Nothing fancy. Just a written description of what the computer should do with its time.
